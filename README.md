# GymBro Weightlifting Mobile App
Cross platform mobile application using React Native, Expo, and TypeScript. This project has taught me a great deal about mobile development and has allowed me to practice organizing a larger codebase and work with several libraries and dependencies.
I implemented TypeScript throughout the project which grants static typechecking and helped significantly reduce debugging and error logging, and it has been excellent to learn and apply industry standard practices.
Additionally, I used React Native UI Library (RNUIlib) for the baseplate of the UI of the application, and I modified some of the components to fit my color scheme and typographies. 
Lastly, for the backend of the project, I hosted the database and user authentication using Google's Firebase and Firestore services. Firebase uses NoSQL architecture, which is different than the traditional relational SQL databases I'm used to. NoSQL provided greater flexibiliy in my project and allows me to store workouts, workout plans, and exercises as sub collections per each user document. Going forward, I intend to learn more about NoSQL and commonly used tools such as MongoDB and implement them in future projects.
